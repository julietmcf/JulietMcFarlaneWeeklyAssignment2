    I like <a href="https://www.claudiatenhoope.com/">this site </a>because the picture is pleasant and is not of the person but it is cute and the rest of the colors on the website match it. 
    I ilke <a href="https://gerinberg.com/">this site </a> because the projects are really organized. If you scroll over them, there is a short description and the site is very uniform.
