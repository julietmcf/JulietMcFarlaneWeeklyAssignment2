Liquor and College Students
This quantitative data analytics project was focused on active liquor licenses in the college town of Boulder, Colorado. My research question was "What is the correlation between the CU Boulder population and active liquor licenses since 1991?" I wanted to explore the impact of college students on the restaurant/bar/liquor store scene. In my findings, I correlated spikes in the CU Boulder student population to increases in liquor licenses. <a href="https://github.com/julietmcf/julietmcfarlane.github/blob/main/INFO%203401-%20Phase%202.ipynb">Click here to view my Github.</a>
