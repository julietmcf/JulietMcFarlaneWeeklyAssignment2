    In the beginning of the semester, I wrote a persuasive essay about the television show Avatar: The Last Airbender. I argued that Sokka was the most underrated character. To create my argument, I used a Kaggle dataset from all 3 seasons. If I were presenting this argument to professionals, I would use RevealJS. RevealJS looks very clean and presentable. It allows you to display information in a powerpoint format that is very easy to read and present. In addition, it allows simple click throughs as to waste 0 time for the audience of busy professionals. I would not need a lot of text on the slides to present it, which is another advantage.

    For people who love and watch Avatar: The Last Airbender, I would present it using Bootstrap. These are the people who care about the show and would like to see nice formatting. It would make it really easy to be informative about the show because there could be different tabs for different arguments about the show. In addition, visuals will be nice for watchers of the show so I could put up Sokka/Avatar: The Last Airbender images without it looking too messy. This audience might want more text than the group of professionals and I can format it to be very easy to read and still have a lot of information.

    I would use Vega for people who do not watch Avatar: The Last Airbender, but are interested in a quick read about the data behind it. Vega allows for visuals that are aesthetically pleasing and informative. This group of people would need something that is easy and quick to read. With Vega, you can customize visuals in a unique way and have scroll-over functions. With that, you can get information extremely quickly without having to look too deep into the visuals.
