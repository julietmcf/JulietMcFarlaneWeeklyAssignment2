  <p>
    Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency, has been an increasingly popular investment despite originally being a joke. It is buildt on blockchain, which is essentially a chronological ledger. It eliminates the need for a central banking authority and makes it almost impossible to hack.   
  </p>
  <p>
    However, Dogecoin has a flaw in that every time a block is verified, the miner receives a fixed reward of 10,000 tokens. If the demand is held constant, the price of it goes down as supply goes up. The price could theoretically go to 0 if the supply escalates. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Because Dogecoin is infinite, miners can continue to solve blocks. Bitcoin is different in that it is limited to 21 million tokens.  Every 210,000 blocks, the Bitcoin earned for solving a block is cut in half. This means there will end up being no rewards. The scarcity of Bitcoin increases its value. In addition, it is the most widely adopted and valuable cryptocurrency. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite its potential to be worthless, Dogecoin has another factor that makes it stand out. It all started on a joke. Markus and Palmer, the creators, did not premine any Dogecoin because they were not serious about the launch of a new cryptocurrentcy. It became popular because of social media and it ended up increasing its value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Markus and Palmer have invested in things like the Jamaica's bobsled team, charities, and raising awareness of the water crisis in Kenya. This along with Elon Musk's tweets about Dogecoin being his favorite cryptocurrency have made people invest. The story behind it is innocent and not very serious, so people want to invest. Maybe you should get some, but also maybe not.
