  Information surrounds every aspect of our daily lives. Whether it’s through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit or any of the other major social media outlets, there just simply isn’t a way to escape it in our society. Through quarantine, the generation that grew up expressing themselves through these platforms has grown even more connected. With the streamlining of remote learning and working at home due to the pandemic, these social media platforms have become a staple in most people’s lives to connect with the outside world Tensions also have never been higher between the middle class of America and the elite upper class. For generations, the elite upper class has ruled over the middle class and profited off of their losses in the stock market. It has finally come to light the way that these billionaires have been able to profit billions of dollars off of companies going out of business. It is this collective combination of being stuck at home, our generation being more connected than ever, and a collective anger at the system that leads us to recent events seen on the stock market surrounding GameStop and other various stocks.

For 10 months now, our entire society has been on a modified version of the reality we are used to. Masks in public, staying at home, and losing loved ones have sadly become the forefront of topics through social media, and is what our generation spends most of its time reading about. When you are stuck at home, you get bored, we’ve all experienced this boredom firsthand. With the creation of commission free trade apps such as Robinhood and TD Ameritrade, retail trading has never been more accessible to the middle class. Buy the stocks you wish with the money that you have, that is the way our free market functions. A group of redditors figured out that hedge funds have been profiting off a process called “shorting.” Essentially what happens is that the hedge funds will purchase stock and sell it immediately at a high price, and then wager that the price of the stock will fall to a certain level by a certain date. On that certain date, the date of expiration for the short, if the stock has fallen to at or below the floor price number that the hedge fund wagered, they can then buy stock at that price and sell it once again and take a profit equal to the difference in prices between when they bought and when they sold at a higher price. This is the hedge funds use of free trade to wager that a stock will decrease a process that is well within their rights. What went wrong for the hedge funds though? Well, this group of redditors decided that since hedge funds wanted the price to decrease, that if a collective group of them bought the stock then that would drive the demand for the stock up. They thought that this would cause the hedge funds' shorts to fail, and for them to have to cover their losses and drive the price for that stock even higher or “to the moon” as the reddit group would say. It is with this realization that hedge funds have been profiting massively off of dying businesses, our jobs being lost, and our economy dying. In other words, they profit when normal people lose money.

Once the word that hedge funds have been profiting during the pandemic while we as a middle class have never faced tougher times, what came next was only inevitable. A viral explosion of the stock that the reddit had discovered had been shorted by hedge funds began. With such a connected society, the word spread beyond reddit to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram where even larger amounts of bored middle-class people decided to collectively “screw” the hedge funds. The key behind the entire GameStop short squeeze was mass amounts of people buying the stock, and then refusing to sell it or “hold with diamond hands” as the reddit would say. This refusal to sell would drive the demand for the stock even higher.  and force the hedge funds to cover by buying even more stock driving the price again even higher. This is exactly what we saw, GameStop’s stock went from under $10 a share to over $400 in less than a week, hedge funds lost billions of dollars, and there was a slight redistribution of wealth from the upper class to the middle class in America.

Shorts wagered by hedge funds are extremely typical and exist everywhere. Companies like AMC, Nokia and BlackBerry are also being shorted by these hedge funds so they may profit off of the companies dying. The redditors decided they didn’t just want to stop with GameStop, they also found out that hedge funds shorted all of those other companies too, highlighting exactly how far reaching and corrupt the hedge funds profiting off of economic downfalls is. This caused an outrage among the middle class participating in this movement, they decided to invest mass amounts of money into the stocks of not only GameStop but AMC, Nokia and BlackBerry as well causing all of the stocks to be squeezed in a similar way to GameStop. It was this anger that led to mass volumes of these stocks being bought and held, squeezing their prices higher, until the retail trading applications, especially Robinhood, decided to make it so that their users could only sell their stock and not purchase any more. This was a direct manipulation of the market in order to help the hedge funds not continue losing billions off of a wager they knew could easily fail. By limiting the amount of buying on these shorted stocks, there was a mass increase in the level of selling vs buying of these stocks which in turn lowered demand and dropped their prices down to their fundamental levels.

History in the making has become normal for us, but this truly is a historical event that took place on the stock market in the previous weeks. Never before has there been a greater redistribution of wealth to the middle class, and never before has the middle class been able to profit off of the elite upper class. There’s no going back to the way it was before. This collective group of retail investors has ruined the short stock game for hedge funds, anytime they short a company this exact thing will continue to happen, and they will lose their money. How will hedge funds make money now? Well, that is a problem for them to figure out because a group of redditors exposed them for their evil ways and has shed a light for retail investors around the country to begin expanding their portfolios and increase their own personal wealth.
